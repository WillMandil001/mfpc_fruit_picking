# This project is to use model free predicitive control to harvest soft fruit clusters.
We will use ProMP's to generate initial trajectories and then use MFPC to maintain a correct path through the environment and ensure interaction with soft fruit has the desired effect, to arive at the goal point.

### Simulation:
- PyBullet environment.
- simple pendulum soft fruits.
- franka panda robot with saga robotics end effector (used in strawberry picking).

### MFPC:

### ProMP:

### Real World Testing:



### TO DO:
- install pybullet.
- get simulation of franka robot working.
- get simpulation of soft fruit working.
